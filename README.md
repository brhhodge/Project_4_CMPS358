The control apparatus can provide power for one to ten sensor arrays as follows: 1 sensor array (100 sensors) for 28 seconds. 2 sensor arrays (200 sensors) for 26 seconds. 3 sensor arrays (300 sensors) for 24 seconds. 4 sensor arrays (400 sensors) for 22 seconds. 5 sensor arrays (500 sensors) for 20 seconds. 6 sensor arrays (600 sensors) for 18 seconds. 7 sensor arrays (700 sensors) for 16 seconds. 8 sensor arrays (800 sensors) for 14 seconds. 9 sensor arrays (900 sensors) for 12 seconds. 10 sensor arrays (1,000 sensors) for 10 seconds. The final hurdle facing Joe is that the sensors are good for one use only. As stated earlier, Joe’s budget is small and he cannot build an unlimited number of sensors. Therefore, Joe must determine in advance of the experiment what combination of sensor arrays and experiment time is most likely to get the best results, i. e. find the most “snipes”. To that end, Joe has written a C# project to simulate the sensors in use over time. This is a Visual Studio Code project located in “SensorSim.zip” on Moodle. Using the project in “SensorSim.zip” help Joe get his degree by determining what combination of time and sensors gives him the best chance of detecting the most “snipes”. When you have made this determination, write the best time and sensor combination that you have found in the report space on Moodle. Include a copy/paste of the best output as it appears in the Visual Studio Code terminal
