# Project_4_CMPS358

Joe Bloggs is a graduate student in particle physics with a small research budget. He is trying to prove that
particles called “snipes” exist so that he can graduate. Unfortunately, “snipes” are hard to observe,
especially on a small budget. Joe has a design for a sensor array that consists of 100 individual sensors, but
he may or may not need to build multiples of his design. An additional constraint that Joe faces is that he
cannot afford a new experimental control apparatus to power the sensors and so is stuck with an existing unit
that he found in the departmental store room.
The control apparatus can provide power for one to ten sensor arrays as follows:

1 sensor array (100 sensors) for 28 seconds.
2 sensor arrays (200 sensors) for 26 seconds.
3 sensor arrays (300 sensors) for 24 seconds.
4 sensor arrays (400 sensors) for 22 seconds.
5 sensor arrays (500 sensors) for 20 seconds.
6 sensor arrays (600 sensors) for 18 seconds.
7 sensor arrays (700 sensors) for 16 seconds.
8 sensor arrays (800 sensors) for 14 seconds.
9 sensor arrays (900 sensors) for 12 seconds.
10 sensor arrays (1,000 sensors) for 10 seconds.


The final hurdle facing Joe is that the sensors are good for one use only. As stated earlier, Joe’s budget is
small and he cannot build an unlimited number of sensors. Therefore, Joe must determine in advance of the
experiment what combination of sensor arrays and experiment time is most likely to get the best results, i. e.
find the most “snipes”. To that end, Joe has written a C# project to simulate the sensors in use over time.
This is a Visual Studio Code project located in “SensorSim.zip” on Moodle.
